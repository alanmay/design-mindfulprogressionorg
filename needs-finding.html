    <h2>Emerging Story</h2>
    Across the research done to date, it appears that a majority of respondents are quite interested in tools to support them with the goal of adding new behaviors
    into their daily routines( genders and ages).  Respondents were motivated by improving their health, reducing stress, and improving themselves, but they
    needed to see fast results.  They were most interested in getting fit and eating right, but reported having been hampered by
    lack of time, motivation, and responsibilities.  Other challenges were trouble with maintaining consistency in their routines, and with getting nearly two hours less sleep per night than recommended.
    Participants were open to a routine up to about 40 minutes in duration, so time efficiency will be at a premium.  They
    largely prefer to work on this as an early morning activity.

            <h4>Background</h4>
            As a first step in this project, this is a initial exploration of
            issues surrounding what a morning routine can be.

            <h4>Goals</h4>

            <ol>
              <li>Put out a feeler for if help with positive habit or routine formation is of interest to respondents
              </li>
              <li>Understand basic demographics of respondents</li>
              <li>Get information on what respondents have already incorporated into their routines and begin to explore
                what challenges they have and what habits they would like to add.
              </li>
            </ol>

            <h4>Constraints:</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>$0 budget</li>
              <li>Given respondents are not going to be paid, this survey should be extremely short with low cognitive
                load required.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Methodology</h4>

            This research method was selected to solicit opinions from a reasonably large number of participants to get
            some insight on whether people wanted help with behaviors or not.
            <uL>
              <li>
                Survey recruitment will be done through austin.craigslist.org's site.
              </li>
              <li>
                Survey delivery will be through a free SurveyMonkey.com's website. This version of SurveyMonkey has a
                limitation that doesn't prevent multiple submissions, but this is not expected to be an issue, because
                there is no significant incentive to do so.
              </li>

            </uL>

            <li>There were 37 respondents when the survey was closed on February 2, 2016.</li>
            <li>Respondents were not paid for their efforts. I am grateful for their participation and
              contribution to this project.
            </li>
            <li>Respondents were >86% female. This raises an interesting question as to whether this was due to women
              having more of an interest in volunteering - or if they had more of an interest in the topic itself.
              The group of respondents had a wide age range.
            </li>
            <li>Many survey respondents are open to participating in providing additional feedback on design
              concepts and early software implementations.
            </li>
            <li>Question 7 was problematic. The question asked the respondents to rank habit options in priority order.
              This structure of this question generates more cognitive load than the others and the user interface on
              some
              browser platforms did not enforce adequate consistency checks.
            </li>
            <li>Open-ended questions had to have HIPAA Privacy Rule related warnings because email contact
              information was collected and respondents potentially could disclose sensitive medical-related data.
              No respondent's actual responses had sensitive data concerns.
            </li>
            <li>
              On reflection, questions 5 and 6 were phrased in a manner that was too leading in nature, hinting at a
              potential solution.

          <h4>Background</h4>
          There were signals of initial interest from the initial interest survey respondents. The next survey is
          here to explore with largely open-ended questions.

          <h4>Goals</h4>

          <ol>

            <li>Understand basic demographics of respondents</li>

            <li>Get insight as to when in the day people are most respondents interested in building a routine</li>

          <h4>Methodology</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Survey respondent recruitment will be done via Amazon's Mechanical Turk.
              Filters will be applied to:
              <ul>
                <li>limit the results to residents of U.S.A. only</li>
                <li>to ensure the respondents had experience on the

                </li>
                <li>their work had a high acceptance rate for previous tasks.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Research has
              shown that
              samples drawn using Mechanical Turk are reasonably representative of US populations but skewing somewhat
              younger and
              somewhat more highly educated than the
              general population. See backing data: <a

                Turk The New Face of Behavioral Science</a></li>
            <li>As a side note: Mechanical
              Turk's population of users is almost exclusively limited to USA and India, due largely to expedited
              payment
              mechanisms available to "Turkers"(paid participants) in those specific countries but not in other
              countries.

          <h4>Summary</h4>
          This survey is to gather more open-ended feedback from respondents about what their motivations are to perform new behaviors as part of their day.


          <h4>Methodology</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Participant recruitment followed the same strategy as survey 1.
            </li>
            <li>100 respondents - 96 is the sample size needed for a 95% confidence level with a 10% confidence
              interval for the population of the US (approximately 319,000,000).
            </li>
            <li>10% is a high margin of error, but given the original budgetary constraints this was an acceptable
              approximation that yielded some interesting insights
            </li>
            <li>To save budget, demographics were not sampled (assuming that the demographics would be reasonably
              close to the survey 1's)
            </li>

            <li>Survey Delivery: The survey was delivered directly on Mechanical Turk</li>

    <h2>Diary Study Focusing on the First Hour of the Day</h2>
    <div class="survey-component">
      Based on the findings in survey 1, there was a clear preference expressed by the majority of respondents
      to work on healthy behaviors first thing in the morning. This diary study's goal is to explore environmental
      factors prior to the introduction of any type of solution.  Although using contextual inquiry was considered, I felt respecting
      people's privacy in such a delicate time of day was more appropriate and a diary study was an agreeable compromise. This method also
      allows for a longer period of reporting, but suffers from self reporting biases.
