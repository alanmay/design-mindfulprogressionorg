            <h4>Methodology</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Survey respondent recruitment was done via Amazon's Mechanical Turk.
                    Filters were applied to:<ul>
                        <li>limit the results to residents of U.S.A. only</li>
                            <li>to ensure the respondents had experience on the
                    Mechanical Turk platform and </li>
                        <li>their work had a high acceptance rate for previous tasks. </li>
                        </ul></li>
                            <li>Research has
                    shown that
                    samples drawn using Mechanical Turk are reasonably representative of US populations but skewing somewhat younger and
                    somewhat more highly educated than the
                    general population. See backing data: <a

                        Turk The New Face of Behavioral Science</a></li>
                <li>As a side note:  Mechanical
                Turk's population of users is almost exclusively limited to USA and India, due largely to expedited payment
                mechanisms available to "Turkers"(paid participants) in those specific countries but not in other countries.</li>
                <li>There were 50 respondents.  49 is the sample size needed for a 95% confidence level with a 14% confidence
                    interval for the population of the US (approximately 319,000,000)
                </li>
                <li>14% is a high margin of error, but given the original budgetary constraints this was an acceptable
                    approximation that yielded some interesting insights
                </li>

        <h2>Survey 3</h2>

        <div class="survey-component">
            <h4>Methodology</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Survey respondent recruitment was done through the austin.craigslist.org site.</li>
                <li>There were 37 respondents as of February 2, 2016.
                </li>
                <li>Respondents were not paid for their efforts. I am sincerely grateful for their participation and
                    contribution to this project.
                </li>
                <li>This was the first survey conducted as an early gauge of interest.</li>
                <li>Respondents were >86% female. This raises an interesting question as to whether this was due to women
                    having more of an interest in volunteering - or if they had more of an interest in the topic itself.
                    The group of respondents had a wide age range.
                </li>
                <li>Survey Delivery: The survey was delivered through a free account on SurveyMonkey.com. Given this was
                    a free account, it suffers from the possibility of respondents taking the survey multiple times.
                    However, this didn't appear to be a problem in practice particularly given there was little incentive to do so.
                </li>
                <li>Many survey respondents are open to participating in providing additional feedback on design
                    concepts and early software implementations.
                </li>
                <li>Question 7 was problematic.  The question asked the respondents to rank habit options in priority order.
                    This structure of this question generates more cognitive load than the others and the user interface on some
                    browser platforms did not enforce adequate consistency checks.
                </li>
                <li>Open-ended questions had to have HIPAA Privacy Rule related warnings because email contact
                    information was collected and respondents potentially could disclose sensitive medical-related data.
                    No respondent's actual responses had sensitive data concerns.
