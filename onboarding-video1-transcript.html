       Welcome to MindfulProgress!  The pace of modern life is staggeringly fast.  Making time for what you find
        important is difficult.  With so many interruptions in the middle of the day, it is challenging to consistently
        carve out time for yourself.
        </p>

        <p>
        What if you started your morning out with some positive actions rather than reading your email, checking facebook, repeatedly
        hitting snooze?
        </p>
        <p>


        You... you are the architect of that morning ritual, and we'll be here to support you.  You select the behaviors you want
            in your morning ritual, and we will slowly build these behaviors up.
</p>
        <p>
            Building positive behaviors into habits using motivation alone is tough, REALLY TOUGH.  Have you experienced this?  I know I've had hard
            days and all of the sudden I've had a setback on my progress.
</p>
        <p>
            The key is to work on making the process of doing the right things easier, even if we have to take some baby steps to get the process going.


        </p>
        <p>
        To get us started, we'd like you to do one 20 second exercise.  Smile.  Smile for 20 seconds with not a "I've got to smile at my dentist before he
        drills four caviities" smile, but a hello old friend kind of smile.  You may want to check in the mirror, you will see
        skin folding around your eyes in a genuninely felt kind of smile.
        </p>
        <p>
        So imagine an old friend you haven't seen in a long time, and send him some good thoughts for twenty seconds!
        Let that smile be free.
        </p>
        <p>
        (twenty seconds elapses)
        </p>
        <p>
        You just released some pleasurable chemicals into your brain and improved your health.  We'll track your lifetime
        with a counter in the right hand corner of the screen.  That counter represents good stuff!
        </p>
