      My background is not in brain research, so I feel quite susceptible to overgeneralizing research findings,
      making na√Øve assumptions, or being subject
      to other biases. I am interested in making relevant corrections as I attempt to translate these research
      results
      into lay language and apply them to software designs. If you have
      corrections or can suggest additional relevant research, please send these to

    <h4>The Brain, A Remarkable Structure</h4>

    <p>
      The brain is a marvelously complex instrument and brain research while making tremendous strides, is still
      in its relative infancy. The brain contains more than 100 billion neurons and each connects
      with between
      1000 and 10,000 other cells. ("Neurons & Synapses - Memory & the Brain - The Human Memory") Consider that
      you have
      25 billion more neurons in your brain than the number of devices of any kind expected to be connected to the
      Internet by 2020 (Danova, 2013)
      The size of this network of nerve cells in each of us is staggering. Many scientists have
      labored long in laboratories to give birth to our current understandings of this structure. Tremendous
      advances
      have been made possible by Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (FMRI) and other imaging technologies to
      help
      researchers map reactions and
      behaviors to structures in the brain.
    </p>

    <p>
      The human brain has evolved over time and contains three major brains within itself that remarkably function
      concurrently. The reptilian complex, the brain stem,
      is the oldest region of the brain and is responsible for maintaining alertness and survival, along with
      managing
      autonomic nervous system functions such as breathing, temperature regulation, and circulation of the blood
      via the heart. As its name implies, we share this structure with reptiles. Fight or flight responses to
      threats
      are triggered from this region and are driven by instincts.
      The limbic system, a brain shared with mammals, is the next system that evolved and is thought to be the
      seat of
      emotion. While the reptilian brain is focused on individual survival, the mammalian brain also is concerned
      with the
      individual in the context of a community. The neocortex, the
      latest region to evolve, is responsible for abstract reasoning.(The Brain from Top to Bottom)
      Through studying patients with brain damage in areas connecting the emotional and reasoning centers, it was found
      that
      using the neocortex alone for decision making was not sufficient to arrive at sound decisions.
      ("How do I decide? The Brain with David Eagleman", 2015)
    </p>

    <p>
      The brain can further be divided into
      regions that are seats for various functions, such as regions that handle feedback from
      our senses such as visual processing. Within the visual processing system, there are many subsystems, for
      managing
      issues we completely take for granted, such as being able to detect edges on surfaces, being able to store
      visual memories, and to be able to recognize that a shape is a human face then match it to a known face.
      ("Visual Processing: Cortical Pathways ") There are many
      such systems in the brain. (http://neuroscience.uth.tmc.edu/s2/chapter15.html)

    </p>

    <p>
      When we imagine all the activities that the mind must
      process as we traverse our everyday lives, it is incredible that our minds can:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>continuously sample and process the input of all of our senses,</li>
      <li>within our consciousness, have access to an understandable representation of our immediate
        surroundings
      </li>
      <li>keep our organs and vital systems functioning</li>
      <li>allow us to anticipate events in the future, and remember past events through visual, auditory,
        olfactory,
      </li>
      <li>enable us to love other members of our species</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We don't have to expend significant conscious energy to figure out the physics involved in lifting nor
      monitoring
      what muscles to flex and extend as the action unfolds to bring a glass of water to our lips.
      In addition, an intriguing finding is that the body often interacts with the subconscious, and physiological
      indicators have been
      measured that show the subconscious and body can form accurate hunches with respect to complicated stimuli
      well before the conscious mind is aware of the same patterns. ("How do I decide? The Brain with David
      Eagleman", 2015)
    </p>

    <h4>Conscious thought is expensive</h4>

    <p>
      Daniel Kahneman has described System 1 and System 2 thinking in his book, "Thinking, Fast and Slow." System
      2
      thinking requires focused effort to analyze a situation, for example, studying a new language.
      System 1 thinking, on the other hand, requires far less
      conscious effort. System 1 thinking often has to do with recognizing unexpected events and seemingly
      automatic
      memory recall.
      System 1 will often, with a minimum amount of data inputs, draw a quick conclusion. Computing
      four plus by four for an educated adult, recalling one's mother's name, and recalling the capital where one
      lives are examples of System 1 thought patterns. (Kahneman, 2013) As one's expertise in a subject increases, some
      thinking in
      this
      domain can shift from System 2 to System 1. One loses access to the details of how one arrives at
      such
      decisions that were once constructed with great focus. For example, if one is an experienced snow skier, the
      mechanics of turning directions, stopping, or traversing a mogul field will be largely automatic versus
      deliberately consciously guided on how to move one's arms, feet, thighs, calfs, and midsection. ("Who is in
      Control? The Brain with David Eagleman, 2015)

    </p>

    <p>
      The brain uses 20% of the body's blood supply and 20% of the oxygen, despite it only
      accounting for 2% of the total mass of the body. ("Neurons & Synapses - Memory & the Brain - The
      Human Memory") The brain uses about the same energy as a traditional 60-watt lightbulb. (("Who is in Control? The
      Brain with David Eagleman, 2015)
      Processing System 1 thinking is significantly more expensive calorically than System 2 thinking and
      significantly slower. As a species that had
      to exist on the savannahs of Africa with big game species that could quickly threaten our lives, having an
      efficient way to
      react to immediate existential threats with System 1 thinking was critical to our survival. System 1's
      influence
      is widespread as a mechanism for quick responses and as an energy saving mechanism. It is often driving our
      behaviors
      when we are not aware of its effect. System 2 thinking may rationalize choices made earlier by System 1
      and not
      be aware that the choices were not made by it directly. Fast thinking has biases that can lead to suboptimal
      decision
      making. System 1 favors short-term benefits to long-term ones, and is loss averse, curiously, it also tends
      to be optimistic and overconfident when gauging one's capabilities. System 1 tends to stereotype stimuli.
      Seeking
      to take in inputs from many sources in one's conscious thinking can counteract many of these biases. (Kahneman,
      2013)

    <h4>Behaviors and Habits</h4>

    <p>
      One of Merriam Webster's definitions for behavior is "anything that an organism does involving action and
      response
      to stimulation". (Behavior, www.merriam-webster.com)
      Behaviors can be one-time events or repeated occasionally or frequently.</p>

    <p>
      The Fogg Behavior Model is helpful for understanding whether a behavior is likely to happen.
      It states that a behavior will occur if the motivation, ability, and trigger all occur above their necessary
      threshold values. Although most behavioral change programs focus on motivation, Fogg recommends focusing on
      abilities
      and triggers for maximum impact.(Fogg, behaviormodel.org)
    </p>


    <p>
      As behaviors become more ingrained
      and routinized through repetition in a consistent context,
      they form habits. Habits tend to occur unconsciously. Habits may be helpful or harmful to the individual. By
      developing
      an understanding of habit formation and disintegration, one can better sculpt the life one wants.
    </p>

    <p>
      Dr. BJ Fogg has defined a two-dimensional Behavior Grid of 15 behavior states with dimensions for repetition
      characteristics
      and behavior type (as in new behaviors, familiar behaviors, behaviors you want to increase in duration,
      etc.) There are
      reports available for strategies for any given cell in the table. For example, there is one documenting how
      one can
      repetitively execute a familiar behavior.
    </p>

    <p>
      Nir Eyal describes in his book "Hooked", a behavior pattern of a software application that seeks to induce a habit
      to provide a timely trigger, which trigggers a simple user action who is given a variable reward, and invests
      further
      the application by contributing content or other participation. (Eyal, 2014, pp. 6-10) The variable reward
      component of this system is powerful. It taps into the highly stimulating release of dopamine associated with the
      promise of reward for the user. The dopamine delivery pathway is a powerful evolutionary arousal drive "chasing
      the promise of happiness", rather than the actual
      fulfillment of reward. (McGonigal, 2012, pp. 105-133)
    </p>


    <h4>Habit Formation </h4>

    <p>
      Although it is a common belief that habit formation occurs in twenty-one days, this has not been validated
      by experimental results.

    </p>

    <p>
      In one study, habit formation for a healthy daily habit was studied based on self-reported user ratings, the
      strength of an added healthy habit grew quickly then plateaued at an average of 66 days (following an
      asymptotic curve). However, the range users reached 95% of their asymptote, was from 18-254 days,
      highlighting the immense variability between subjects to solidify their habits.
      Habits involving simpler actions were built more quickly than complex ones.
      Habit formation was not appreciably impacted by missing a day.
      Extrinsic rewards were not provided, but the subjects were allowed to select the habit to build.(Lally, 2009)
    </p>

    <p>
      Another study examined the habit formation for exercise workouts. Four workouts a week for six weeks was the
      minimum effort required to build
      a successful new gym-based workout habit. To form the habit,
      workouts need to be (ranked with most important criteria first):</p>
    <ol>
      <li>consistently performed</li>
      <li>simple and easy to understand</li>
      <li>fun</li>
    </ol>
