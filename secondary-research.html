            My background is not in brain research, so I feel quite susceptible to overgeneralizing research findings,
            making naïve assumptions, or being subject
            to other biases. I am interested in making relevant corrections as I attempt to translate these learnings
            into lay language and apply them to software designs. If you have
            corrections or can suggest additional relevant research, please send these to
            <a href="mailto:alan@mindfulprogression.org?Subject=Mindful%20Progress%20Research" target="_top">alan@mindfulprogression.com</a>

            The brain is a marvelously complex instrument and brain research, while making tremendous strides, is still
            in
            its relative infancy. The brain uses 20% of the bodies blood supply and 20% of the oxygen, despite it only
            accounting
            for 2% of the total mass of the body. The brain contains more than 100 billion neurons and each connects
            with between
            1000 and 10,000 other cells. The size of this network of nerve cells is staggering and many scientists have
            labored long in laboratories to give birth to our current understandings of this structure. Tremendous
            advances
            have been made possible by FMRI and other imaging technologies to help researchers map reactions and
            behaviors
            to structures in the brain.

        Habit Formation

        <ul>
            <li>Habit Formation for a healthy daily habit - Based on self-reported user ratings, the strength of an
                added healthy habit grew quickly then plateaued at an average of 66 days (following an
                asymptotic curve).

            <ul>
                <li>However, the range users reached 95% of their asymptote, was from 18-254 days,
                    highlighting the immense variability between subjects to solidify their habits.
                </li>
                <li>Habits involving simpler actions were generally built more quickly than complex ones.</li>
                <li>Habit formation was not appreciably impacted by missing a day</li>
                <li>Extrensic rewards were not provided, but the subjects were allowed to select the habit to build</li>
            </ul>
