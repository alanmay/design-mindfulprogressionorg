        <h3>Domain-Aware Opinionated Non-Technological Solution</h3>

        <h4> Solution Description </h4>

        <p>The user is guided through a sequence of tasks when they first wake up. This solution presupposes that the
            user is willing to be guided through a sequence of tasks to build positive habits. The list and order of
            tasks
            has been predetermined by a behavior designer, based on scientific research and other pragramatic
            considerations.
            The difficulty of tasks starts very simple and progressively increases in difficulty as the days go by. For
            example, to begin building a habit of working out in the morning, the related task the first week may only
            involve putting on
            one's running shoes.
        </p>

        <p>The user is given two large decks of cards, similar to the card decks you find in the board game "Trivial
            Pursuit".
            Similar to "Trivial Pursuit", the user would take a card from the front of the deck, do the task described
            then place the card at the back of the deck to preserve the relative order.</p>

            <img src="images/Build%20Deck.png"/>
            <figcaption>The user would start on the tasks in the build deck.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <figure>
            <img src="images/Maintain%20Deck.png"/>
            <figcaption>After completing all the days in the first deck, the user would switch to the maintain deck. The
                idea would be to repeat the actions in the maintain deck when the user completes it.
            </figcaption>
        </figure>


        <p>Both decks are filled with cards with a similar format. There are daily summary cards and individual task
            cards. </p>

            <img src="images/summary%20card.png"/>
            <figcaption>The daily summary card from the Maintain Deck - The time estimate could be visible above the
                deck line so that the user could know how long the next
                day's activities will take without removing a card
            </figcaption>
        </figure>

            <figcaption>The back of a task card from the Build Deck</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            An additional document (or a series of videos on a website or dvd) is needed to teach the user how to do the
            non-obvious habits, such as how to meditate and how to do various exercises properly.
        </p>
        <h4>Considerations</h4>
        <h5>Pros</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>No technology required - widest possible market</li>
            <li>Physical reminder as additional supportive trigger to action</li>
            <li>Provides gradual skill building (consistent with BJ Fogg's behavior model)</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Cons</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>The user isn't given a choice on which habits they wish to build</li>
            <li>It is difficult and impractical (but not impossible) for the user to add or remove tasks.</li>
            <li>There is no adaptivity or supportive for user lapses. The user only proceeds with the progression when
                he resumes. For tasks like a workout, this might be difficult given losses in strength
            </li>
            <li>The variety is limited to the number of cards.</li>
            <li>There is no tuning by the designer possible to a released deck of cards.</li>
            <li>Limited capability for solution to provide positive feedback (perhaps occasion additional cards with
                congratulatory
                notes or inspirational quotes)
            </li>
            <li>Environmental impact of paper required for printing the materials</li>
        </ul>
