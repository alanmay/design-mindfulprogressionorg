        <h3>Domain-Aware Single Time of Day Targeted Solution</h3>

        <h4> Solution Description </h4>

        <p>
          This would be a solution that focuses in on one specific need.  Following the data, the biggest requests
          were for fitness and nutrition supports.   So this might entail building a fitness application, in the vein of
          Sworkit or 7 MWC that is intended to support a morning workout.  There is significant exploration needed to seek out
          what to bring into existence that adds to the breadth of choices for consumers.
        </p>
        <p>
          One option for such a solution could be a fitness tool
          that targets the least fit individuals, providing them with supports for very gradually increasing their fitness
          through a conservative carefully planned morning workout.  In this case, careful consideration of handling of user
          setbacks should be a focus.
        </p>



        <h5>Pros</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Opportunity to build a single use application - ability to apply narrow focus and craft a polished solution to a
          high impact problem</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Cons</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Only addresses one issue</li>
          <li>Harder to anchor to an existing behavior (unless the user has such a behavior that they want to use, such as waking.)</li>
        </ul>
