        <h3>Domain-Aware Technological Solution</h3>

        <h4> Solution Description </h4>

        <p><a href="core-flow-storyboard.pdf">Here</a> is a storyboard describing the core flow.


        <ul>
            <li>For all habits supported, look for any avenue to reduce barriers to users being successful</li>
            <li>Supportive feedback in all interactions</li>
            <li>User has ability to reduce the time demands on a busy day while still building the seed of the habit
            </li>

            <li>Build positive habits via smart phone app initially. Rationale:
                <ul>
                    <li>Smartphones and the combination of smart phones and smart watches provide interesting form
                        factors and capabilities for a tool such as this. Smart
                        watches are a growing segment, but with less than 30,000,000 units projected to be in use
                        globally
                        at the end of 2015. <sub>1</sub> Given limited resources and , It makes more sense to start with
                        a phone application.
                    </li>
                    <li>10% of US population have no broadband access at home, but have a smartphone<sub>2</sub></li>
                    <li>15% of Americans have few other options besides their cell phone <sub>2</sub></li>
                    <li>15% of those aged 18-29 rely heavily on smartphones for internet access <sub>2</sub></li>
                    <li>93% of users view smartphones as helpful <sub>2</sub></li>

        <a href="/dailyflowchart.graffle.pdf">This</a> flow chart describes the daily flow of the user.
        <p></p>


        <h3>Design Questions/Alternatives</h3>

        <h5>How should a user indicate which habits he or she is interested in building?</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Option A: Choose a group of individual potential habits from a list during onboarding or at the
                point when you unlock the right to build a new habit.
            </li>
            <li>Option B: Choose an aspirational theme or themes ("I would like to be" ... "fit" or "balanced" or
                "creative")
                during onboarding and have that drive mapping to habits
            </li>
            <li>Option C: "Baseball Catcher" type approach. Catcher suggests possibilities that the pitcher can
                override. Similarly, the app suggests the highest potential return habits or those which have the
                most logical ordering for practical/logistical reasons
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            These options go in order of rank from most user determined to most guided. BJ Fogg (Director, Persuasive
            Tech Lab - Stanford) and Erik Heckler (Director, Designing Health Lab - Arizona State University)
            put emphasis on the importance of user agency, that overly directed models, even when built with
            well-reasoned evidence based medicine and research, seem to fail. The problem may lie in user buy in.

            Initial designs will be based on Option A, but this will be a line of inquiry during user testing
        </p>


        <h5>How should habits be chained such that the user doesn't get bored nor discouraged?</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Option A: Build habits serially (with a threshold of "mastery" to unlock additional habits)
            </li>
            <li>Option B: Build small versions of a series of habits ("floss one tooth") to reduce habit initiation
                cost
            </li>
            <li>Option C: Take a hybrid of A & B. Start with small versions of some habits and build them in
                duration/complexity and have the ability to unlock additional habits with mastery.
            </li>
        </ul>


        <p>
            This seems like a rich topic for exploration. If we record the user's success or failure on completion of
            a requested task, the model can be refined and gutted if necessary. To start with Option C does not add
            significant additional complexity for building an iteration of the product, so this will allow us to
            collect more data points.
        </p>


        <h5>On the third volunteer-only survey through Austin Craigslist, the respondents were 80%+ female (with a wide
            distribution in ages from 18-59). Is the demographic result being indicative of
            general relative interest, or perhaps women in Austin are more interested in than men in volunteering, or
            just small sample-oriented bias/noise? If it is indicative of
            relative interest, how should the deliverable be focused on women's needs?
        </h5>

        <p>
            More data is needed. This could impact a number of facets of the application's final design, from
            options for habits to be formed, to data collected, to visual elements of the app. There was also a wide
            distribution
            of ages of the women from 18-59. The project may also want to further narrow the target audience to, for
            instance, a given age demographic. The Amazon Mechanical Turk
            study 1, indicated interest by members of both sexes and across a wide age range in an offering.
        </p>

        <h5>Are there other habits that were not specifically requested, but may be high return on investment for the
            user or serve some other purpose (like being a helpful beginning or ending anchor activity)
        </h5>

        <p>Accomodating the person's need to go to the restrooom and perhaps recommending that one make one's bed if it
            is empty on wake up.
            Admiral McRaven made a very compelling argument for making one's bed every morning in this speech. His
            description of an anchor habit is completely in synch with the spirit of this project.</p>

        <h5>What strategies do users find most compelling for establishing trust, conveying a positive energy, and
            keeping the users engaged?
        </h5>

        <p>
            Some proposed initial strategies to test:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li> An always present, monotonically increasing count of healthy habit actions performed to date
            <li> Option upload of a picture of loved ones to motivate one to get started
            <li> A positive message in a down to earth tone in videos
            <li> Positive findings displays (ex. graphs of weight loss during a period of time when behaviors have been
                consistent)
            <li> Short form encouragement or celebration videos from other users
            <li> Short form encouragement or celebration videos from celebrities
            <li> Admitting when we don't have the best solution for a specific set of needs (user who is solely fitness
                focused, for example, might be served better by the 7-minute workout app)
        </ul>
